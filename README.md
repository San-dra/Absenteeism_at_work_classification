Predicting Absenteeism at work
The experimental data we are going to use is a version of the Absenteeism at
work Data Set. This is a binomial variable setting whether individuals are going to be absent more than X (X = 5) hours in total
(i.e., if it's going to be a long absence).

** Testset: Absenteeism at work classification test.csv.
